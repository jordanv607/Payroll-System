Elite Seguridad Payroll System.


## Description.

This is a payroll system for my father's security company called: Elite Seguridad. In this application you can easily manage the company's personnel by creating, deleting or editing the employees in regards. Followed by this, the system is capable of generating a payroll list when a date is provided for the corresponding payment of the employees. As a final result, the application can generate a report in PDF, Excel or Word format of the Company's payroll either by date or by the ID (Costa Rican identification). 

This application is based on the ASP.net framework, in a responsive web version. In addition, this application involves the management and knowledge of databases so it includes both 'back end' and 'front end'.
